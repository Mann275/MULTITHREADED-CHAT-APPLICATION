## TASK DESCRIPTION

This Java project demonstrates a **multithreaded client-server chat application** using Java Sockets. It enables real-time communication between multiple clients via a central server.

### Key concepts covered:

- Use of `ServerSocket` and `Socket` classes for TCP connections  
- Handling multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading  
- Broadcasting messages from one client to all others  
- Clean disconnection and thread-safe message handling  
- Console-based communication without GUI  

This application showcases Java's capability to build basic networked systems.

## HOW TO RUN

### 1. Compile

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory containing the `.java` files:

```bash
javac ChatServer.java ChatClient.java
```

### 2. Run the Server

```bash
java ChatServer
```

> Leave this terminal open â€” it will handle all client messages.

### 3. Run Clients (in separate terminals)

```bash
java ChatClient
```

- Enter a name when prompted.  
- Type messages to broadcast to all connected clients.  
- Repeat this step to simulate multiple clients in different terminal windows.

## CONCLUSION

This project provided practical experience in Java network programming using sockets and multithreading. It is a foundational exercise for understanding how real-time systems work, and can be extended into more advanced messaging platforms with features like private messaging, chat rooms, or GUI integration.
